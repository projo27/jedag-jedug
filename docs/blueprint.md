## Core Features:

- Real-time Audio Input: Capture audio directly from the system's microphone or speakers for live, instantaneous visualization.
- Audio File Processing: Upload and process various audio file formats (MP3, WAV, etc.) to drive visualizations, allowing for pre-recorded content.
- Dynamic 3D Visualization: Render mesmerizing real-time 3D visuals using Three.js and React Three Fiber, dynamically reacting to audio analysis data.
- Shader-based Visual Patterns: Utilize custom GLSL shaders to create a wide array of sophisticated, customizable, and unique visual effects for deep immersion.
- AI-powered Shader Generation Tool: Generate or suggest unique shader code variations and visualization patterns based on selected moods, styles, or complexity levels, leveraging generative AI capabilities to inspire creativity.
- Visualization Control Panel: Provide an intuitive user interface to adjust various visualization parameters (e.g., colors, intensity, speed, geometry) in real-time.
- MP4 Export Functionality: Export the live or pre-recorded audio visualization as a high-quality MP4 video file, leveraging FFmpeg integration for robust output.
- Dark and Light theme support: Dark and Light theme support

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant, energetic magenta-purple (#D62EE2) to highlight interactive elements and draw attention, chosen to evoke a modern, high-tech and dynamic atmosphere.
- Background color: A very dark, slightly tinted grey (#21141F), providing a deep and immersive canvas that makes the primary colors and visualizations truly pop, suitable for a dark visualizer theme.
- Accent color: A rich, slightly deeper violet (#8029CC), serving as a complementary highlight for secondary UI elements or subtle visual cues, creating good contrast with both primary and background.
- Unified font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for all text. Its computerized, techy aesthetic perfectly matches the app's real-time audio visualization and generative features, providing a modern and legible interface.
- Minimalist and geometric line icons, ensuring they are sleek and align with the tech-savvy, abstract nature of the 3D visualizations.
- An immersive, full-screen visualization experience with a clean, uncluttered interface that can dynamically appear or disappear. Controls should be discreet and contextual.
- Subtle, fluid UI transitions and reactive animations on interactive elements, offering smooth feedback that complements the real-time audio visuals without distracting from them.
